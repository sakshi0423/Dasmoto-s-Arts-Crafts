# Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

In this project, youâ€™ll build a simple website for a fictional arts and crafts store using the tools on your own computer. This project will provide you with less guidance than previous projects. You should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

This project will require the following:

  - A folder structure that makes sense for the project
  - An HTML file
  - A CSS file

> Project 3 in the Codecademy Web Development Course Module 2: Styling a Website
